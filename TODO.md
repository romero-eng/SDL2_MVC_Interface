# Potential API Improvements:

**General**

1. Add Stack Traces to customly thrown errors

2. Add std::swap() to Move semantics for Texture, Surface, Renderer, and Window classes

**Renderer Class**:
1. Implement Rendering of Geometry (i.e., [SDL_RenderGeometry()](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/SDL_RenderGeometry) and [SDL_RenderGeometryRaw()](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/SDL_RenderGeometryRaw))
